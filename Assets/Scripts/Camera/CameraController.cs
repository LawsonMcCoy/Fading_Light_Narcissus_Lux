        /*
        The first step to finding the camera position for current spherical position around the player
        is to compute a unit vector point from the player to the correct camera position. To do this we
        will start with Vector3.up. We want any rotation of the player that modified the player's up vector
        to change the position of the camera. Doing so causes disorientation and it is clear from playtesting
        that making these rotations of the player is displeasing to the players. Therefore we will use Vector3.up
        here instead. Next we will find an axis that when the camera above the player is rotated by phi (note domain 
        of 0 to pi) degrees, it will be behind the player. To be behind the player we need two things. First we have
        to rotate away from the player's forward vector, which implies that the plane of rotation contains the player's
        forward vector. The second thing we need is for the plane of to contain Vector3.up, so the camera doesn't move
        to the side. With these two conditions we can compute the desire axis of rotation as player.transform.forward
        crossed into Vector3.up. With the axis of rotation we can now start by rotating the camer direction vector phi
        degrees around this axis of rotation. Now we will apply a second rotation to the unit vector, this time theta 
        degrees around Vector3.up. After both rotations we will have successfully obtained a unit vector pointing from 
        player to the desire camera location. 
        */

        With the camera direction vector all that is left to do is to scale it by the distance the camera should be from the player and 
        the resultant vector to the player's position. However there is one little complication. The x component of the spherical position
        is the desire distance between the camera and the player, but this distance may or may not place the camera behind a wall. To check 
        for this we will use the player's position and the camera direction to perform a raycast. If the path is clear then we are good to
        put the camera at the distance we want. However, if the raycast does hit a wall then we have to place the camera at the surface of 
        the wall instead.
